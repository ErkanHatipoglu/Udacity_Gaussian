The course is not available at the moment and was a part of *AWS Machine Learning Foundations Course*. 

This is a package that contains code to analyze Gaussian and Binomial distributions.

The package can:

- Read in a dataset,
- Calculate the mean,
- Calculate the standard deviation,
- Plot a histogram of the dataset,
- Plot probability density function of a Gaussian distribution,
- Add two gaussian distributions.

## Install

pip install distributions-EH
